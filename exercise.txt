4)     write a program to findout given number is prime number or not. 
5)     write a program to findout given number is armstrong number or not. 

for loop 
--------------------
1) write a program to check whether given number is armstrong number or not
input : 153 output it is armstrong number 
input : 135 output it is armstrong number 
input : 531 output it is armstrong number 
input : 241 output it is not armstrong number 
process 
input 153 1x1x1 5x5x5 3x3x3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
input 241 2x2x2 4x4x4 1x1x1 = 8 + 64 + 1 = 73
