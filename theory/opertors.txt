what are the operators?
------------------------------------------
some special symbols which are used to do some operations are called operators.

let us see few very common operators like + - * / %. these all are operators used in mathematical process. 

there are 2 main categories of operators
    binary operators
        binary operators works upon 2 value/variable. value or variable upon which operators work are also known as operands 
        like + - / * % 
        for example 
        c = a + b  OR printf("%d",a+b);
        c = a - b  OR printf("%d",a-b);
        c = a * b
        c = a / b
        c = a % b

    unary operators
        unary operators works upon 1 value/variable
        for example 
        a = -a; //
        a++ // or a = a + 1 
        ++a // or a = a + 1 
        --a  // or a = a - 1 
        a--  // a = a - 1

use wise categories of operators 
------------------------------
 
1) arithmetic operators
  it is used to do mathematical operations 
  examples are + - * / %
 
2) relational operators / comparison 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  it is used to compare variables/value. it always give result in terms true (1) or false(0)

  1 == used to check 2 variable has same value or not  
  2 != used to check 2 variable has different value or not  
  3 a<b  used to check whether left side variable is less then right side variable or not 
  4 a>b  used to check whether right side variable is greater then left side variable or not 
  5 a<=b used to check left side variable is less then or equal to right side variable
  6 a>=b used to check right side variable is greater then or equal to left side variable

3) logical operators.
    logical operators are used to join two or more relational expressions and it also returns either 1 or 0. there are 3 logical operators
         for example 
         (1)   (2)
         a < b logical-operator b > c 
         a < b && b > c 
         a < b || b > c
         !a == b  
        
        1) and operator (&&)
            and operators check both relational expressions. if both expressions are true(1) it return true(1) otherwise it return false(0)
        2) or operator (||)
            or operators check both relational expressions. if any one of the expressions are true(1) it returns true(1) otherwise it returns false. 
        3) not operator (!)
            not operator reverse result of any relational expressions. if relational is true it returns false. if relational expressions false it return true

4) assignment operators
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    assignment operators are used to write down any mathematical expressions in shorter way. 

    assignment operators 
    a = 10 
    b = 1
    += can be as a+=b when we need write a = a + b
    += can be as a+=1 when we need write a = a + 1
    -= can be as a-=b when we need write a = a - b
    *= can be as a*=b when we need write a = a * b
    /= can be as a/=b when we need write a = a / b
    %= can be as a%=b when we need write a = a % b
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    unary operator

        1 operands and 1 operator
        a++  can be write as a = a + 1 (postfix)
            first assign and then increment 
        ++a can be write as a = a + 1 (prefix)
            first in increment then assign
    a = 10 
    b = 0 
    b = a  // 10 
    a= a + 1 // 11

    OR 
    b = a++ (postfix )
    
    a = 10 
    b = 0 

    a = a + 1 
    b = a 

    OR 
    b = ++a
