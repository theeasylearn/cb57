what is limitation of normal variable?
----------------------------------------
normal variable can store only one value at a time. if we store another value, previous value will be lost. many times we need to store lot of related values then we have to create many variable. more variables means more complex program and complex program are difficult to understand and change. 
we must try best to write easy to understand to code. to do that we need to declare less variables. 

when we need to store many related values of same type, we should use array.

what is array/List?
--------------
array is special type of variable in which we can store multiple values. each value in array has same name but unique position. 1st value in array is at 0th position, 2nd value in array is at 1st position. it means position start from 0. position of last value is size of array - 1. technically position is called index.  it must be positive integer value. index can be given directly or using variable's value

all the value in array must be same type in c language.
size of the array must be set at the time of creating array. 
during execution of program size can not be changed. 
we can change value at any given position. but we can not add & delete value. 

how to create an array?
syntax 
------------------
datatype array[size];

example
int age[5];

how to store/change value in array?
age[0] = 25;

how to access/display array
printf("%d",age[0]);

how to take input from user into array
scanf("%d",&age[0]);

types of array 
one dimensional array 
    if array has only one dimensional then it is called one dimensional array. in short it is called 1D array. 1d array is vector

two dimensional array 
    if array is created in 2 dimensional, it is called two dimensional array. 
    2d array has 2 dimensional one is horizontal and 2nd is vertical. 2d array is like table in excel. where horizontal lines are called row and vertical lines columns. combination of row and column is called cell. same concept allow applies to 2d array in c language. 2d array is matrix.

--------------------------------
how to create 2d array?
syntax 
    datatype array[row][column]
example 
    int sales[4][7];

how to take input from user in 2d array?
scanf("%d",&sales[0][0]); //it will accept input from user and store in 0th row 0th column. 

how to display value from array
printf("%d",sales[0][0]); //it will accept input from user and store in 0th row 0th column.
