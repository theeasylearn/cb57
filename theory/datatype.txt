Common Datatypes, Sizes, and Ranges

The ranges are based on the two’s complement representation for signed types, which is standard in most systems. The sizes and ranges below are typical for modern 32-bit or 64-bit systems.

    int (signed int):
        Size: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits).
        Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (i.e., -2³¹ to 2³¹ - 1).
        Format specifier: %d or %i.

    unsigned int:
        Size: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits).
        Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295 (i.e., 0 to 2³² - 1).
        Format specifier: %u.

    long int (signed long int):

    Size:
        Typically 4 bytes on 32-bit systems (same as int in many cases).
        Typically 8 bytes on 64-bit systems (e.g., GCC on Linux, Windows 64-bit).
        Note: On some systems (e.g., Windows with MSVC), long int is 4 bytes even on 64-bit systems.
    Range (assuming 8 bytes on a 64-bit system):
        Minimum: -2⁶³ = -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (LONG_MIN from <limits.h>).
        Maximum: 2⁶³ - 1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (LONG_MAX).
        For 4-byte long int: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (same as int).
    Format specifier: %ld (for printf and scanf).

    unsigned long int:

    Size: Same as long int (4 bytes on 32-bit, 8 bytes on 64-bit systems).
    Range (assuming 8 bytes):
        Minimum: 0.
        Maximum: 2⁶⁴ - 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (ULONG_MAX).
        For 4-byte unsigned long int: 0 to 4,294,967,295 (same as unsigned int).
    Format specifier: %lu.
    
    float:
        Size: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits, IEEE 754 single-precision).
        Range: Approximately ±3.4 × 10³⁸ (with 6–7 decimal digits of precision).
        Format specifier: %f.
        Note: Exact min/max values are complex due to floating-point representation, but practical limits are around ±3.4E+38.

    double:
        Size: Typically 8 bytes (64 bits, IEEE 754 double-precision).
        Range: Approximately ±1.7 × 10³⁰⁸ (with 15–16 decimal digits of precision).
        Format specifier: %lf.
        Note: Much larger range and higher precision than float.

    char (signed char):
        Size: 1 byte (8 bits).
        Range: -128 to 127 (i.e., -2⁷ to 2⁷ - 1).
        Format specifier: %c (for character) or %d (for numeric value).

    unsigned char:
        Size: 1 byte (8 bits).
        Range: 0 to 255 (i.e., 0 to 2⁸ - 1).
        Format specifier: %c (for character) or %u (for numeric value).
